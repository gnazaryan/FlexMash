			<tr>
				<td><u>Problem:</u></td>
				<td style="padding:10px; padding-left:40px;">The scenario the Mashup is executed in is very time-critical, i.e., it is of vital importance that the Mashup is
					executed as fast as possible to receive the integrated result. Especially in situation recognition and exception
					escalation scenarios, time is the most important factor. That is, the time-critical requirement is above all other
					requirements such as robustness, security, data persistence etc.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><u>Solution:</u></td>
				<td style="padding:10px; padding-left:40px;">A fast execution engine is chosen with a suitable execution language. The Mashup Plan will be mapped onto
					this language and execute into the engine.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><u>Example:</u></td>
				<td style="padding:10px; padding-left:40px;">We use the fast and efficient, however, non-robust execution engine Node-RED which has a lack of
					robustness regarding data persistence, error handling etc. However, the time-critical requirement is fulfilled.
				</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><u>Evaluation:</u></td>
				<td style="padding:10px; padding-left:40px;">Using this pattern enables its advantages especially in time-critical scenarios such as the integration of sensor
					data for situation recognition. However, the disadvantages of this pattern are many. By just including the timecritical
					requirement, no important factors such as error handling, logging or data persistence can be provided.
					This can lead to an unstable Mashup execution. In conclusion, this pattern should be used connected with other
					patterns or in prototypical, non-production environments.</b>
